# 10 способов стать более уверенной девушкой

Картинка: GIRL POWER

Больше всего на свете я хочу, чтобы ты знала, что ты — крутая красотка.

Пока ты не начнёшь ценить свою чуткость, целостность, чувство юмора, креативность, изящество, упорство, ум, и предприимчивость — наряду с многими другими своими сочными качествами — ты будешь бороться с чувством, что с тобой что-то не в порядке.

Цель этой книги — вдохновить тебя чувствовать себя смелой и уверенной, чтобы ты стала выражать себя честно, открыто и ярко.

----

Уверенность имеет большое влияние на то, какое удовольствие мы получаем от жизни. Люди, которые уверены в себе и довольны собой, позитивно влияют на всех окружающих.

Ты когда-нибудь видела девушку, на которую все обращают внимание, когда она заходит в комнату? Люди тянутся к ней, и она легко начинает разговор с кем угодно. Она уверенная!

Когда уверенный человек заходит, все это замечают. Такой человек может познакомиться с кем угодно, и вовлечь кого угодно в разговор. Он стоит с высоко поднятой головой и источает уверенность.

## 1. Привыкни к непривычному

Быть за зоной комфорта должно стать комфортным

  Step 4
  
  Take risks and take action! Your comfort zone is not the place to stay! If you want major change in your life, you must change those self-limiting beliefs that have kept you from having what you’ve wanted in the past. 
  
  Step 5
  
  Try new things! Learn a new skill or try a new hobby. Don’t be worried about failure or rejection. Failure is an opportunity to learn. If it didn't work out, figure out why, make some changes and try it again. 

## 2. Хвост виляет собакой

Сознание и тело — единая система.

  Step 8
  
  Enter every room with confidence. First impressions are always important. Before you enter any room check your body language…the non-verbal communication that speaks volumes! Take a few deep breaths slowly exhale, stand up straight, eyes up. Always put on a big smile and expect that you are going to have a good time and meet some great people. Check your self-consciousness at the door. 
  
  Step 3
  
  Practice good posture at all times (sitting, standing, walking), especially when you're walking alone.

## 3. Выгляди лучше

  Step 4
  
  Stay well groomed. Wash your hair often (enough for your hair type) and bathe yourself often. Don't get too obsessed every minute on how you look. One of the important things about being confident is being comfortable with yourself and your body. Be mindful of wearing clothes that are too revealing or too small for your body type, as they can be unflattering. If you feel the need to, carry simple things with you like a small hairbrush, lip gloss/chap stick, and a small bottle of body spray.
  
  Step 5
  
  Shop for clothes, or make them, to create your own unique style. Buy what you like to wear and what makes you happy. Don't wear anything just because a certain crowd is. If you like the normal jeans and t-shirt look then, it's totally you. As long as you're comfortable, you'll become confident. Follow your own standards.

  Step 7
  
  Personalize your look. Being unique and confident is all about your personal uniqueness. If you like wearing jewelry, go for it! If you don't like wearing jewelry, that's your personal taste and no one should tell you otherwise. Your hairstyle, hair color, shoes, purse and other accessories are other ways you can personalize your look. Like jewelry, these things are not for everyone and you shouldn't do it if you don't feel comfortable with it.

## 4. Развивай навыки коммуникации

  Step 11
  
  Speak properly, clearly and audibly, and don't swear a storm. If you have a swearing problem, make up your own "swear word replacements". Instead of saying the 'F-word', replace it with the word "frick" or "fudge." A simple word replacement is always better than the actual swear word. If you can, eventually eliminate these slang terms.

## 5. Дружи с людьми

  Step 3
  
  Remember people’s names. When you first meet someone ask for the person to repeat their name, so that you can connect the name to the person. Say their name as often as possible, and repeat it to yourself inside your head 5 times. If their name is unusual, ask how they spell it and where it is comes from. 
  
  Step 15
  
  Let go of friends who do not respect you or like you for you. If you feel your friends have less respect for you, talk to them. Let them know how you feel, tell them how you expect to be treated, and offer solutions. If someone makes you feel bad or not good enough, they are not your friend and you should dump them immediately. .
    
  Step 16
  
  Make friends with the people you like, not the ones you think you should be friends with.


  Step 19
  
  Socialize and make friends with your parents, and make conversation with adults, but remember to be polite.
  
  Step 18
  
  Stay nice to everyone you come across, and smile at people when you pass them while walking. Embrace differences in others and celebrate diversity.
  
## 6. Делай комплименты

## 7. Принимай комплименты

  Step 24
  
  Learn that if someone comes up to you and says "You have a great figure" or "You have, like, perfect lips" thank them and smile. Not only will it make you happy, but it will also make someone else feel good that they did something nice. They also might become your friend.

## 8. Не пытайся быть удобной

  Step 17
  
  Understand that it is not healthy to let your peers or students walk all over you, this is big problem if you're shy or the type of person who really likes to please people. Don't be afraid to say "no" if the situation calls for it. Example situations would be if a friend asked you to help them cheat or copy off of your homework.

  Step 21
  
  Remember to never feel pressured into doing drugs, getting drunk, or having sex. These are one of the biggest problems as a teenager. Drugs are not a good thing in the first place and it is preferable that you don't do it at all. It can do serious damage and ruin your good reputation. Don't go out and get drunk. First off as a teenager, you're underage. Second, getting drunk can be dangerous, you can do things you'll regret.

## 9. Не пытайся всем нравиться

  Step 23
  
  Forget any slights and don't take insults to mind. If someone calls you a mean name, shrug it off, however, if someone compliments you, take it in. Think about it.

## 10. Не выделывайся

  5.  Confident women don’t show off or talk themselves up.
  Confident people don’t need to tell the world how great they are. Only insecure people secretly feel that they are unworthy and feel the need to hide this by bragging about their achievements or talking themselves up.
  A woman who reveals herself gradually, carefully peeling back the layers over time, is significantly more attractive than a woman who lays it all out there. When you feel that you are worthy, you don’t need to tell people…they just know. A big mistake insecure women make in the early stages of dating is selling themselves to a guy. This can be completely innocent, but it comes from a deeper sense of insecurity and inadequacy. Confident women don’t need to sell themselves; rather, they use dating as a means to determine which guys are worthy of their time and affection.

  Step 6
  
  Don't ever care what people think about you, as long as you know what you are doing is right and it's not hurting anyone. And never be scared to do the right thing.

## 11. Не реагируй на мудаков

  Step 6
  
  Ask yourself "So what?" Whenever you feel yourself holding back or when someone else is doing or saying something that affects your level of confidence, ask yourself "So what?" For example:
  “I want to stand up for myself and say something, but they are going to disagree with me”. So what?
  "I want to go to that event, but I'm scared that I won't know very many people." So what?
  "I might forget what to say next during a presentation." So what? 

  Step 7
  
  Realize that you're basically saying to yourself: Who cares? And why should I care? Most people unnecessarily put way too much significance on the thoughts and opinions of other people. Generally speaking, people do not want to see you fail. When you are watching someone else give a presentation, you are not in the audience hoping that they make a mistake, right? People want to see you be successful too. 


## 12. Развивайся и становись лучше

  Step 1
  
  Start taking risks, because every risk you take makes you a more confident and stronger person. However, understand that there are positive risks and negatives risks. Do the things that lead you forward toward your goals.
  
  Step 2
  
  Define what your goals are by writing them down. Set realistic, attainable goals so that you aren't let down if you can't accomplish everything at once. Take it one step at a time and think positive!

  Step 12
  
  Develop your talents. If you're good at dancing, take up a class and polish your skills; if you're good at sports, take lessons and join a team.
  
  Step 13
  
  Join some clubs if you're a good socialite or want to get over your shyness. It can boost your confidence level, help you develop your social skills, and help you make some friends.
  
  
  Step 14
  
  Participate in your hobbies. If you love music, go ahead and don't be afraid to whip out your IPod or CD player (If the time is important of course) Read books or write poetry if you love it. Paint, draw, swim, or watch Anime if it's your personal thing. Everybody has different hobbies and there's nothing wrong with expressing it. Remember: It's all about what makes you happy, not doing it because someone else wants you to. Find things you're passionate about and don't be afraid to try something new.

## 13. Доверяй себе

  4. Confident women trust themselves and the decisions they make.
  confidence-tips-2A key component of having high self-esteem is trusting yourself to make the right choices while also realizing you are well equipped to cope should things go awry. People with high self-esteem don’t constantly question their actions and feel conflicted about the right thing to say or do. They act on how they feel and are comfortable being their true, authentic selves.
  People with low self-esteem don’t trust their judgment, don’t trust their gut instincts, and are afraid of being wrong. As a result, they either live their lives in a constant state of anxiety, or they look to others to guide them along the right path. This obviously does not do much to help one’s sense of autonomy, which is also a key element of healthy self-esteem.

## 14. Верь в себя

  Step 1
  
  Use positive affirmations. Have several positive sentences that you repeat to yourself many times. It's a very powerful way to program the subconscious mind and create action. 
  
  Step 2
  
  Use positive words to describe what you want to have happen and say it with feeling and conviction. 

----  
  
  Step 25
  
  Practice looking at yourself in the mirror and saying, "I love you!" or, "Look at me...I look beautiful today."...you could grab a chair and sit in front of the mirror, and state all the good things about you, the things that make you a beautiful girl just the way you are. Don't compare yourself to a movie star.
  
  
  Step 26
  
  Ask for Help If you're in a bad mood a lot or can't get along with your family, ask your parents, a teacher you trust, someone at a church or a school guidance counselor for help. If you don't take care of yourself, your emotional health, you could make bad decisions that you'll regret later. Tell someone if you're scared or upset and that you want help to make yourself feel better.
  
  
  Step 27
  
  If someone is being mean to you, just say "don't be pathetic" and walk away.
  
  You don't need to be rich to be confident! You can buy clothes from Payless, Target, or Ross which carry many of the stylish and trendy brands for affordable prices (and no one has to know!)
  
  Take good care of yourself in every way. Healthy people are confident people. Constant exercise increases your confidence in every way. You feel and look better and even move different. Join a gym, jog, play soccer or basketball and try to eat light protein meals at least 5 times a day. Power bars are good to keep in your backpack at school.
  
  If you value your brains that start working hard to improve them. Intelligent people have tons of confidence. Read, apply for honor classes, get mostly A's on tests. Organize your priorities and honor them!
  
  Don't look like you are trying too hard. Keep your hair, makeup and nails on the more natural side. It looks classier and more easy going.
  
  Get busy. Try to challenge yourself all the time. Don't expect to be perfect or not make mistakes. Make your own decisions about school.
  
  Make time for yourself. Be alone and enjoy it! Think about what you value in people, school and your life.
  
  Try making friends that make you feel good about yourself, instead of being around people that making you feel lonelier than you truly are.
  
  Make sure you're getting enough sleep. Most girls need at least 8 hours or more. Take a nap on the weekend if you are exhausted.
  Try to improve your communication skills so that people will understand you. Acting moody or sullen does not get you anywhere.
  
  If someone tries to tempt you into peer pressure, it's perfectly okay to say no, as long as you are calm and polite about it. "Hey, wanna smoke with us tomorrow night?" A reasonable answer to this, if it's not your thing, could be something like: "I'm not so much into that, but I'm going to the movies Saturday, wanna join?"
  
  Set realistic goals for yourself. Do you want to be known for your personality, brains or sport abilities? Or all three? Get organized and write down what you want. Make step-by-step detailed lists on how you will achieve your goals. For example if you want to be known as the girl with a "great" personality, than try to be more relaxed, playful (just not in class), flexible, friendly and open. Compliment or notice a different person everyday but be sincere. Expect yourself to be very honest and not lie so people will trust you. Allow yourself to change and grow.
  
  Be healthy! Make sure you're getting enough vitamins and minerals, and eating enough from each of the food groups. Exercise at least 3 times a week. Try jogging and build up to 3 miles (4.8 km) if possible. Get involved with after school sports teams.
  
  Try to learn how to let insults not get to you.
  
  Always keep a smile on your face. It will make you look cheerful.
  
  Stay motivated. Don't give up trying.
  
  You have the right to end any hateful conversations. Just walk away.
  
  If someone insults you, let it go. Don't worry about it. You are not responsible for other people's behavior, actions, feelings or problems.
  
  Do not overdo it if your not liked by some people. Keep a sense of humor about yourself.
  
  If you're having serious problems with a close friend, don't start a fight. Calm down and use your words. Talk it out and respect their feelings. Treat them with dignity. Tell them you expect them to be always honest with you.
  
  Being confident means not caving into peer pressure. You make up your own mind about things.
  
  Say no if something doesn't feel right or dangerous. Stay away from self destructive people who get into drugs, vandalism or gangs.
  
  Avoid acting arrogant to hide your insecurities. Most people don't like it and can see through it.

  1. Be a “passionista.” First thing’s first: Sit down and really ask yourself, What do I want and what makes me happy? “You’ll only find your passion if you search and fight to discover it,” Jones writes. “You have to get out there in the world and do things that scare you.”
  
  2. Be first. Skipping something you love (The gym? A massage? Girls’ night?) to keep open to plans with your significant other isn’t helping either of you. “When being selfless becomes so automatic that your instinct is to think of others first and you second, you’ve lost grasp of who you are and what you need,” Jones says. You are the priority.
  
  3. Be hard-core. That job application you still haven’t finished? Do it. “Idleness prevents us from reaching our potential,” Jones explains. Keep your work ethic in check and stop making excuses.
  
  4. Be unpopular. It’s more than okay to be the friend who orders a salad at a burger joint (or vice versa)—and that applies to far bigger things, too. “Stop worrying so much about the naysayers and surround yourself with people who support your dreams,” she says.
  
  5. Be bold. Dream big, then challenge yourself to chase that dream. “The people who have done, seen, and accomplished amazing things in this world have done them not because they lack fear, but in spite of it,” Jones says.
  
  6. Be resilient. A break-up? Work troubles? “It is precisely when everything as we know it is turned upside down that we have the opportunity to evolve,” Jones counsels. “Life is about moving through those obstacles with grace— and sometimes that involves clenched fists, a tear-streaked face, and some four-letter words.” Buy some (natural) waterproof mascara and keep on keeping on.
  
  7. Be a sponge. When Jones graduated from college, she “cold-called 20 female executives in the entertainment industry,” looking for guidance, she says. “To my surprise, not just one or two, but all of the women called me back.” In a week, she’d nabbed 20 interviews with some of the most powerful and influential women in Hollywood. The lesson? Be brave in tracking down a mentor, then make it a point to soak up his or her knowledge.
  
  8. Be of service. Actually do those Flywheel charity rides, or that 5K-for-a-cause you’ve been meaning to sign up for. True fulfillment requires more than “the right husband, perfect children, your dream job, or the perfect body,” Jones says. “When we’re pouring out our heart and serving others, we find the ingredients of real joy and wholeness.” 
  
  1. They embrace their purpose
  These women know their strengths well and make sure they put themselves in both personal and professional situations where they can utilize these skills. They focus on what they excel in, more than dwelling on their weaknesses.
  
  They acknowledge that they have imperfections, but realize this is part of being human and make every mistake into a personal learning experience.
  
  2. They practice a self-confidence ritual
  Giving themselves a pep-talk whenever they need a little extra confidence, either before a big work presentation or even working through a fight with a loved one, is what make these women stand out.
  
  Whether the ritual entails affirmations while looking at themselves in the mirror or putting on a special outfit that makes them feel good inside and out, these women know what ritual works for them when they need a confidence boost. And, more importantly, they are not afraid to use it.
  
  When asked by Women’s Health magazine what helped her gain self-confidence, Michelle Obama gave sound advice with, “Well, sometimes I give myself a break. So I will retreat a moment from the fray, just to breathe. Because what I’ve learned is that my immediate reaction cannot be the deciding reaction.”
  
  3. They enjoy spending time alone
  Reveling in a few moments to themselves during the day to relax and feel free of others’ obligations is a must. Women who are confident are also empowered by going out alone, whether it is to see a movie or enjoy a leisurely dinner at a local restaurant.
  
  These women cherish their friends and family, but also realize that it is important to have their “me” time, where they can shamelessly indulge themselves. And they can always be social when they are ready.
  
  4. They refuse to buy into the media’s image of a perfect woman
  These women do not let the media dictate their physical appearances or behaviors, because they know that it is all false advertising. These women are confident in their lifestyle choices, whether they decide to get married and have a family or not.
  
  They do not feel the need to be stick thin just because it is commonly seen on TV, but instead they know the value of a healthy, active lifestyle.
  
  Actress Jennifer Lawrence voiced her opinion about the media’s effect on young girls when she said,“I think when it comes to the media, the media needs to take responsibility for the effect that it has on our younger generation, on these girls that are watching these television shows and picking up how to talk and how to be cool.”
  
  5. They refuse to take anything too personally
  Letting the hard days and moments in their lives roll off their shoulders is what defines these women, because they know how to keep everything in perspective. Women who have confidence always see the bright light at the end of the tunnel and refuse to wallow in their own pity, because they know it will only harm them in the end.
  
  Confident women are also aware that they cannot control other people’s emotions, only their own, and that is what matters.
  
  Maya Angelou said, on the importance of being authentic and not focusing on the little things, “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”
  
  6. They ask empowering questions
  Asking questions that make them a better individual and have a direct correlation to their own self-fulfillment is another thing that these women have in common. They realize that asking themselves the “why me” question is detrimental to their own well-being and contentment in life.
  
  They make sure to eliminate the negative broken record that plays in all of our heads and replace it with positive questions like “what do I need to do to be happier in life?” and then follow through with immediate actions.
  
  7. They ask what they can do to improve the world
  Asking themselves how they can use their strengths to make the world that they live in a better place is a common trait for these women. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, was often referred to as the “First Lady of the World,” because of the self-assuredness that she displayed while fighting for human rights.
  
  This selflessness is one of the key factors for confident women, since they know what they are capable of and would like to share their talents with others.
  
  1. They admit their flaws.
  
  No one is perfect. As much as we hear this trite nugget, a lot of us do not take it to heart. (Nudge, nudge.)
  
  Self-assured women not only admit their imperfections, they applaud them. They know where their strengths lie, where they can improve and when to get the heck outta dodge and let others take the lead. Trying to be perfect at everything is inefficient, and confident women ain't got no time for that. They love themselves for who they are -- and for who they're not.
  
  2. They say no.
  
  Now, some people may think this practice is betchy (the PC version of b*tchy), but in reality, it's pretty respectful. Confident women don't overcommit and they don't make false promises. They just say no. Why? Because they'd rather state the truth and decline rather than tell a white lie and then flake out later. And, they don't have time for everything. No one does. The difference is, burnout simply isn't on a confident woman's agenda, so she makes sure to commit to things she'll actually enjoy instead of piling every little thing onto her calendar for the sake of other people. Truth bomb.
  
  FYI: Confident women do RSVP, because, well, not doing so would actually be betchy.
  
  3. They listen.
  
  While self-assured women trust their own judgment, they are also secure enough to listen to others' opinions. They won't necessarily like what they hear all the time, but they don't throw a tantrum just because their boss didn't like their PowerPoint. They get that criticism should be taken as constructive, and that listening to others' answers is a good way to get their question resolved. Le duh.
  
  To sum this up Twitter-style: Listening >Talking #blessed
  
  4. They don't conform.
  
  Confident women don't wear, say, listen to, do, or become anything they don't believe in, because they aren't walking cookie cutters. They left the desire to fit in back with their battery-deprived Tamagotchi the second they realized they were friends with a whiney Etch A Sketch. Confident women don't mirror others to find what makes them happy -- they are brave enough to look within.
  
  Slow clap.
  
  5. They're open to love.
  
  Regardless of how brutal or shameful one's romantic past may be, the opportunity for love is hardly off the table. A failed relationship is an opportunity. These women reflect on why it didn't survive (he was stupid), work to better their own unfavorable behaviors (OK, maybe I told him he was stupid a lot), and then search for a more compatible partner (one who isn't stupid).
  
  Kidding! Ha.
  
  Horribly lame jokes aside, confident women don't let their past hold them back. They know they are worthy of a great relationship, strong enough to survive if it doesn't work out and fabulous enough to weather the crappy outcomes.
  
  6. They ask for help.
  
  So important. These women know trying to accomplish everything alone is virtually impossible. Self-assured women don't feel threatened or belittled by seeking help from coaches or counselors. Just like a CEO has an entire team to assist with daily functions, confident women have a support group ready to go.
  
  Mental tune-ups are their soy vanilla lattes. They value a third party bringing out the best in them. Plus, they have someone to blab to about that epic slip-up with you-know-what at the you-know-where and stuff got real.
  
  Sounds intense, girl. Blab to counselors, not to coworkers.
  
  7. They own their feelings.
  
  No matter what the circumstance is, confident women strive to understand their emotions AND own up to them. There's no hide and seek happening with their jealousy -- they let it all out.
  
  Self-assured women take the opportunity to express themselves without blaming others, and confirm that they are understood. Then, they return the favor by listening to the other side. And then, they ride off into the sunset with their homies and get ice cream, because it's all good now.
  
  8. They release guilt
  
  Guilt is supposed to be a temporary emotion. It pushes us to understand our actions, act to correct the mistake and apologize. But that's it. Guilt is not meant to spam our emotional foundation. Confident women listen to their guilt, figure out how to right their wrong and then they release it. Wam, bam, thank you, spam.
  
  9. They support others.
  
  Self-assured women love watching their friends soar. Cheering on others' businesses, relationships and successes does not impede on any of our own accomplishments; it highlights them!
  
  ALL of you have heard the phrase, "guilty by association," right? Yeah, your moms probably mentioned that to you a few times in high school, ya little troublemaker. So, use it to your advantage! A killer social network only makes mommy proud.
  
  Want to be confident?
  
  Then always keep in mind that confidence can grow. Remember what we talked about in #6? Good. That's the key to becoming better in this tricky department. If you're looking for more information, you can always come say hi to me and my frands here!
  
  1. They live their purpose.
  
  Your purpose is to be authentically you. No more, no less. When you applaud your fears, neuroses, and quirks, suddenly these qualities become your assets.
  
  Insecure about your body? So are millions of other women — embrace your goods and teach others to embrace theirs! Shameful of your intelligence? Forget the degrees and do what makes you feel like a genius! When you’re living your truth, you’re unstoppable.
  
  2. They practice their unique ___ (Fill in: calming, uplifting, etc.) ritual.
  
  Some of the greatest thinkers, artists, speakers, lawyers, and performers of our time have a preperformance ritual that gets them revved for show time. While a unique ritual is about doing, it's also about feeling. A ritual creates the feeling you desire before you actually get to the doing.
  
  For example, if I want to have rockin’ confidence before a date, I’ll strut around my apartment in high heels. If I want to feel calm, I’ll focus on my exhale breaths. We all have rituals that calm our nerves, get us in the game, or prepare our mindset for focused action. Know yourself and what you need to get in the zone.
  
  3. They spend (and love) time alone.
  
  A drop in confidence can come when plans aren’t made or fall through and you’re left with time alone. How empowering is it when this time comes as a gift?!
  
  There's nothing that revives my confidence more than time alone. Wait, let me clarify: time alone that I occupy with self-love. If I spend my alone time wallowing in misery, I perpetuate my insecurities. When I shower myself with love, in the form of a bubble bath, rest, or yoga, I realign with my core values.
  
  Know what you need to make this precious time with yourself the best time. There is nothing sexier than a woman who ADORES her own company.
  
  4. They take nothing (or very little) personally.
  
  Do you know any confident woman who takes everything personally? Those with true confidence know that any perceived ego blow is more a reflection of the speaker than of them.
  
  When you’re able to hear criticism and not take it personally, your reactions change. You’re able to feel compassion and love for all, regardless of how they treated you. Life isn’t as much of a drama. Confidence emerges naturally with life-love.
  
  5. They ask empowering questions.
  
  We’re constantly making evaluations for what things mean and what we should do. Such neural associations are initiated by questions. Simply, the more empowering questions we ask ourselves, the more confident we will be.
  
  If you ask disempowering questions like, “Why does this always happen to me?” your mind will come up with an answer. In contrast, ask, “What am I happy about now? What could I be happy about if I wanted to?” Or if there is a problem, ask, “What is great about this problem? What can I feel grateful for?” Then you can shift into the confidence required to solve it.
  
  When empowering questions become second nature, you have no choice but to find confidence-inducing answers.
  
  ----
  
  Healthy self-esteem is a prerequisite for healthy relationships. From my personal experiences, and my years spent writing about relationships, I’ve learned that poor self-esteem is the number one cause of unhealthy relationships, as well as the top relationship killer.
  Self-esteem isn’t an essential need like food or water, but it’s a supplement that can either dramatically improve your life, or keep you stunted and unfulfilled. The fact is, you can only let in as much love from the outside as you feel on the inside. If you don’t feel good about yourself, you will never truly believe that someone else can love you and you will constantly be on the lookout for the other shoe to drop, for the guy you care about to leave, thus validating the fact that you are unworthy of love.
  
  Poor self-worth is what traps us in bad relationships, what sabotages new relationships, and what causes us to feel so devastated and broken when a relationship ends.
  Self-esteem doesn’t come from blowing kisses to your reflection in the mirror or repeating “I love myself” over and over. It takes time and it takes work and it isn’t always easy. Everyone’s path will be different, but no matter what, having a picture of what high self-esteem looks like, and how it can play out in relationships, is helpful and can help reveal the areas you may need to work on.
  Having high self-esteem doesn’t guarantee a happy relationship, but it does equip you with the skills to identify what you want and realize you deserve to get it, and the strength to walk away if something falls short. Here are ten things people with high self-esteem do differently in their relationships:
  
  1. Confident women don’t analyze if he likes them – they assume he does.
  People with high self-esteem believe they are worthy of love and don’t question how someone feels about them. They know that they are good, competent, and lovable and trust that the right person for them will see this. They don’t attach their worth to what a guy thinks and, as a result, don’t feel stressed and anxious when a guy’s feelings are unclear. Instead, they assume he likes them and are able to be present in the relationship and enjoy it without being weighed down by fears and doubts.
  
  2. Confident people realize if a relationship falls apart it’s because it wasn’t right, not because they did something wrong.
  confidence-tips-1-useNot everyone is a match and sometimes, two people are just incompatible. This doesn’t make either of them flawed or bad – sometimes it’s just not there. Confident women don’t take it personally when a guy doesn’t want a romantic relationship. They realize that it must not be the right match and they move on, with their sense of self firmly intact.
  When a girl is insecure, however, and a guy leaves, she spirals. She may obsess, analyze, and replay every interaction in an attempt to uncover what she did wrong. She may know on a conscious level that it simply wasn’t a match, but deep down she holds on to the destructive belief that she was the problem…and that she is unlovable and the guys she wants will never want her back.
  
  3.  Confident women set healthy boundaries.
  Healthy personal boundaries and high self-esteem go hand in hand. Having strong boundaries means you prioritize your needs and your emotions and do not assume responsibility for someone else’s needs and emotions.
  Confident women know what they will and will not accept and don’t allow themselves to be pressured or guilted into doing things they don’t want to do. They act in accordance with who they are and what they believe and don’t cater their behavior for a guy, or do things solely to keep him interested and happy. When you have weak boundaries, you may sell yourself out in a relationship and put up with treatment that you know is objectively unacceptable. Confident people don’t abandon parts of themselves in order to have a relationship. They bring their fully formed self into the relationship and if the guy wants something else, or something more, they leave.
  A woman with healthy boundaries will not lose herself in a relationship, and will not allow her identity to be entirely contingent upon how he sees her. She will continue to maintain her own life outside of the relationship without giving up her friends, hobbies, or alone time. She won’t abandon important parts of herself or her life for the sake of the relationship and if a guy wants something else or something more than she’s willing to give, she’ll leave.

  6. Confident women accept responsibility.
  Couple Having Argument At HomeConfident people accept responsibility for their actions and emotions. They don’t blame or shame their partners if they feel unhappy and don’t accuse him of “making” them feel a certain way. They don’t blame men for being jerks and they don’t view themselves as the victims of other people and circumstances.
  They realize that their time is their responsibility. As a result, they don’t wait around in dead-end relationships, hoping something will magically change. And they don’t blame their exes for wasting their time. They take responsibility for their choices, both good and bad, and use mistakes as opportunities to grow and become even better.
  
  7. Confident women take the relationship for what it is and don’t need it to be a certain way.
  Confident people feel secure in their relationships. They don’t need to have a title or a ring as some sort of confirmation that the guy cares. They are able to just be present and in the relationship and let it unfold organically, without force or pressure. This is not to say they stay with guys who won’t commit and are all cool and go-with-the-flow about it. If a guy can’t commit in the way they want, then they’ll move on. They are able to give and receive freely in their relationships and as a result, they don’t stress out about labels. They just know that if it’s right, it will work out. And if it’s not right, they’ll move on.
  
   8. Confident women don’t stay in bad relationships.
  Confidence-tips-4Confident people do not stay in relationships where they don’t feel respected, appreciated, and valued. And they don’t assume full responsibility if a relationship isn’t working and take it upon themselves to try to solve the problem by giving and doing more. They aren’t afraid to walk away when something isn’t working and the thought that they won’t be able to find better or that they will wind up alone doesn’t cross their mind. The can quickly see when a situation is damaging and will remove themselves immediately.
  Only insecure people put up with treatment that is unacceptable, in large part because they feel that that’s what they deserve on some level. When you learn to value yourself, you will weed out anyone who doesn’t truly value you.
  
   9. Confident women don’t desperately seek reassurance.
  People with high self-esteem know they are loved and lovable. They don’t need a guy to remind them every day – it’s just something they feel and know. When you are insecure, you need constant validation and become resentful if your partner doesn’t give it to you. You blame him for “making you” feel insecure in the relationship, or unloved. You may work harder to try to please him and earn his love, or you may withhold your love and affection to even the score. This manifests as neediness (the number one relationship killer): you need constant reassurance and if you don’t get it, you lash out and blame your partner for not providing it.
  The fact is, if you don’t feel good about yourself, nothing he does will ever … (continued – Click to keep reading 10 Things Confident People Do Differently in Dating and Relationships)

  We don’t enter the world with it. No one has it all of the time. Talking about it won’t help you gain it. I’m referring to self-confidence. We women have particular difficulty developing self-confidence. We instinctively focus on everyone but ourselves. So taking the time for self-development doesn’t come naturally to us. Girls often are encouraged to be passive, and not too daring or confident. After all, we don’t want to threaten all those guys out there!
  
  We turn on the television or read the paper, and are bombarded by examples of women with great self-confidence. They have a kind of chutzpah that we can’t seem to muster. Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Sandra Day O’Connor and Madame Curie are but a few examples.
  
  So how do these women create the belief in self required to push the limits of their abilities? How do they continue to try, even at the risk of public failure and humiliation? If you asked them, their formula for self-confidence would likely include the following ingredients:
  
  Take responsibility for yourself. This is the first and most important ingredient in the self-confidence formula. You, and only you, can make new things happen in your life. If you wait for serendipity to provide you with good fortune, or with increased confidence, you’ll be waiting a long time. Realize that the path toward self-confidence is one that you will have to travel — no one else can do it for you.
  
  Begin to experiment with life. Try something new. Go out to dinner alone. Take a class in an unfamiliar subject area. Teach yourself how to repair a toaster. Testing your abilities at new endeavors is a wonderful way to learn that you can rely on yourself.
  
  Develop an action plan and implement it. Select one area for personal or professional development. Determine the action steps you will take to get there. Put these steps on a timeline. Now implement each step according to plan — no excuses. Every small step you take will be a great boost to your confidence!
  
  Stick with it. When you take on a new challenge, stick with it. Self-confidence doesn’t come from each thing you attempt. If it did, one failed effort would bring you back to zero on the confidence scale. True confidence develops from an increasing belief that you can rely on yourself to take action and follow through, no matter what the result.
  
  Act “as if.” If you put off taking action until you have confidence, you’ll never do it. In the field of psychology we have come to understand that by changing our behavior, we can change our feelings. So if you take action, and do so with a semblance of outward confidence, the inward, true feeling of confidence, will follow.
  
  Find a mentor. Do you know someone who is confident and continues to take one new risk after another? Watch how they do this. Muster up the courage to ask them to meet you for coffee. Find out how they do what they do, and ask them for feedback about your action plan and implementation. Most confident people are happy to help. They remember the courage and effort it’s taken them to get where they are today.
  
  Well, the truth is “out of the bag.” No more excuses. No more wistful sighs, as you think about that successful gymnast you met, or the woman you read about who returned to medical school in her 60s. Right here, right now, you have the formula to develop your own confidence. So head for the laboratory and start creating, adding one ingredient at a time.
